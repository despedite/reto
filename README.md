## ⚙️ RETO LEGACY IS DISCONTINUED
The Discord.py project that Reto uses has been discontinued, and changes needed to keep the bot running after the fact are non existing in the current code-base. As such, the following code, messy as it is, won't be getting any future updates. Thank you for using Reto throughout the years!

## 🤖 Reto
> Reto is a community-oriented Discord bot, featuring a karma system, a way to reward the best comments, leaderboards, and so much more! React to a post with the `plus` or `minus` emojis to give said user some points for their content. `Curators` can even star (react with the exclusive `10` emoji) posts to give them extra points, and add their comment to a special "Best Of" channel for all to admire!
